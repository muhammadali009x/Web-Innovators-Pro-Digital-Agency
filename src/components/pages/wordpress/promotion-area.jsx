`,
    des: `Back in 2013, while managing a bookstore, I found myself exploring WordPress during my free time. What started as casual tinkering quickly turned into a deep passion for CSS and web design. This newfound interest led me to take on personal projects, and before long, I was crafting websites for smaller businesses. Over the next decade, I transformed from a complete beginner to a seasoned WordPress developer. Today, as the head of a digital agency, I can confidently say it was a journey well worth taking.
`,
    des2: `Along the way, I’ve had the opportunity to work with numerous CMS platforms and frameworks. However, much like your first car, your first CMS holds a special place in your heart. For me, WordPress remains that "first car." Even as an agency manager, I still relish the chance to get involved in project work and use WordPress for developing. There’s something uniquely rewarding about stepping back into the platform that kickstarted my career in web design.
