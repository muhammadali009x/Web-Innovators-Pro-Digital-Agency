                                            <h2>Step 1: Creating a New Article</h2>
                                            <p>
                                                To get started, log in to your Joomla administrator panel. Then, follow these steps to create a new article:
                                            </p>
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>Navigate to <code>Content &gt; Articles &gt; Add New Article</code>.</li>
                                                <li>Once on the article page, give your article a title in the Title field.</li>
                                                <li>An Alias will be automatically generated based on the title. The alias is used for the page URL but can be manually changed later if needed.</li>
                                                <li>Assign the article to a category if applicable. Categories help keep your content organized, but if you’re just starting, you can leave it as “Uncategorized.”</li>
                                                <li>You now have a blank article ready to be filled in!</li>
                                            </ol>
                                        </section>

                                            <h2>Step 2: Adding Text to Your Article</h2>
                                            <p>With your new article created, it’s time to add content.</p>
                                            <p>
                                                Use the built-in editor to type your text or copy and paste content you've written elsewhere. The editor is intuitive and works much like a word processor. You can format your text using bold, italics, bullet points, and other basic styling options.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                For example, highlight a section of text and click the <strong>B</strong> icon in the toolbar to emphasize keywords or headings. With the text in place and styled, your article is starting to take shape.
                                            </p>

                                            <h2>Step 3: Adding an Image to Your Article</h2>
                                            <p>Images can make your article visually appealing and engaging. Here’s how to add one to your Joomla article:</p>
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>Place your cursor where you want the image to appear.</li>
                                                <li>Click the <strong>Insert &gt; Image</strong> option or the image icon in the editor toolbar.</li>
                                                <li>Select an existing image from your Joomla media library or upload a new one by clicking the <strong>Upload</strong> button.</li>
                                            </ol>
                                            <h3>Uploading a New Image</h3>
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>Navigate to <code>Content &gt; Media</code> in a separate tab.</li>
                                                <li>Upload the desired image from your computer.</li>
                                                <li>Return to your article, and insert the newly uploaded image.</li>
                                            </ol>
                                            <p>Your image should now be embedded within the text. Be sure to preview your article to ensure the placement complements the content layout.</p>

                                            <h2>Step 4: Publishing Your Article</h2>
                                            <p>With your article complete, it’s time to make it live on your website. Publishing an article in Joomla involves linking it to your site’s menu so visitors can access it. Follow these steps to publish your article properly:</p>
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>Go to <code>Menus &gt; All Menu Items &gt; New</code> in the administrator panel.</li>
                                                <li>Give your Menu Item the same title as your article, making it easy to locate later.</li>
                                                <li>Under Menu Item Type, choose <strong>Articles &gt; Single Article</strong>. This connects the menu item to your new article.</li>
                                                <li>Select your newly created article from the list.</li>
                                                <li>Choose the specific menu where you’d like the article to appear (e.g., Main Menu).</li>
                                                <li>Ensure the Status is set to “Published,” then click Save.</li>
                                            </ol>
                                            <p>When saving the menu item, Joomla will automatically generate an alias for the article’s link. If it’s too long or complicated, feel free to shorten it to something clean and memorable. Finally, refresh your website’s frontend to see your new article displayed under the chosen menu.</p>
