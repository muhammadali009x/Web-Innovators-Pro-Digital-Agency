                                            <p>Think of Joomla extensions as apps for your website. They are tools that help your site do more—whether it's adding forms, galleries, or advanced functionalities like e-commerce integration. All Joomla extensions are hosted in the <a href="https://extensions.joomla.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joomla! Extensions Directory (JED)</a>, which works like an app store dedicated to Joomla.</p>

                                            <h2>How to Install a Joomla Extension</h2>
                                            <p>Joomla offers four main methods to install an extension. You'll need access to your site’s backend to proceed.</p>
                                            <h3>1. Install from Web</h3>
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>Log into your site’s backend and go to <strong>Extensions &gt; Install</strong>.</li>
                                                <li>Use the search bar to find your desired extension directly from the JED.</li>
                                                <li>Select the extension and click the <strong>Install</strong> button.</li>
                                                <li>The installation is automatic and generally completes in under a minute.</li>
                                            </ol>
                                            <p>This method is ideal when the extension you need is listed in the JED.</p>
                                            <h3>2. Upload Package File</h3>
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>Download the extension ZIP file from the developer's website.</li>
                                                <li>Go to the Install page and choose the <strong>Upload Package File</strong> option.</li>
                                                <li>Click <strong>Browse</strong>, select the downloaded ZIP file, and start the upload.</li>
                                                <li>The installation process will complete automatically.</li>
                                            </ol>
                                            <p>This is a common method when your extension isn't available directly in the JED.</p>
                                            <h3>3. Install from Folder</h3>
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>Download the ZIP file from the developer's site and upload its contents to a folder in your web server. Use an FTP client to handle the upload if necessary.</li>
                                                <li>Specify the folder's location in the Install from Folder field.</li>
                                                <li>Click <strong>Check and Install</strong>.</li>
                                                <li>The installation will run automatically.</li>
                                            </ol>
                                            <p>This method is useful when handling larger extensions or if your web hosting restricts uploads.</p>
                                            <h3>4. Install from URL</h3>
                                            <ol>
                                                <li>Copy the download URL from the extension's website.</li>
                                                <li>Paste the URL into the Install from URL field.</li>
                                                <li>Click <strong>Check and Install</strong>.</li>
                                                <li>The process will complete automatically.</li>
                                            </ol>
                                            <p>This method is convenient for downloading and installing extensions directly online.</p>
