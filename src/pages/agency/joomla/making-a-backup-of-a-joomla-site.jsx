                                            <h2>The Easy Way vs. The Hard Way</h2>
                                            <p>There are two primary methods to back up your Joomla site:</p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><strong>The Easy Way</strong> – Use a Joomla extension like Akeeba Backup. This method simplifies the process, making it faster and more user-friendly.</li>
                                                <li><strong>The Hard Way</strong> – Create a backup manually by copying website files and exporting databases. This method requires more technical knowledge and time.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p>For most users, we recommend the first option. However, we'll explore both approaches in detail below.</p>

                                            <h2>Creating a Manual Joomla Backup</h2>
                                            <p>Prefer the hands-on approach? Creating a manual backup involves two main steps: saving your files and exporting databases.</p>

                                            <p>Use an FTP client (like FileZilla) to connect to your site. Download all Joomla files and folders to your local computer. If you’re unsure how to use an FTP client, Joomla’s documentation provides helpful guidance.</p>
