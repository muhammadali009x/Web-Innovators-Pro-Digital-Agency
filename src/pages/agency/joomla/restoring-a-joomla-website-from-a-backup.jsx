                                            <p>When restoring a Joomla site, your approach depends on how your backup was created. If you used an extension like Akeeba Backup, the process is relatively straightforward. If your backup was done manually, it will require more effort. This guide walks you through both methods to ensure the best outcome.</p>

                                                <li>Finally, remove the installation directory by clicking <strong>Remove the installation directory</strong>, and then finalize the restoration by clicking <strong>Finish Restoration</strong>.</li>

                                            <ol>
                                                <li>Use an FTP client to access your server. (If you're unfamiliar with FTP, check out our article on setting up FTP access.)</li>

                                            <p>If the methods above feel overwhelming or unsuccessful, your hosting provider may offer backup restoration services. Most hosting providers routinely create server-level backups. Contact your host's support team to verify if a backup is available and request a restoration. Keep in mind that this often restores all files on your server—so it’s best used as a last resort.</p>
