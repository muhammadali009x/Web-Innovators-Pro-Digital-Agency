Many paid extensions offer a basic, free version. This is a fantastic way to try them out, understand the interface and features, and decide if upgrading to a full version is worthwhile.

                                            <h2>What Types of Extensions Are There?</h2>
                                            <p>
                                                Joomla extensions are categorized into five types, each serving a unique purpose. Here’s an overview to guide your selection process:
                                            </p>

                                            <h3>1. Components</h3>
                                            <p>
                                                Components are the core building blocks of Joomla, much like apps on a smartphone. They manage specific functionalities and have two parts:
                                            </p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><strong>Frontend</strong> – Visible to your site visitors (e.g., the content a viewer sees)</li>
                                                <li><strong>Backend</strong> – Accessible through the Joomla Administrator area, enabling you to configure settings</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p><strong>Examples of Components:</strong></p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Akeeba Backup: Simplify website backups with flexible options for recovery and automation.</li>
                                                <li>AcyMailing: A robust tool for managing newsletters and email campaigns.</li>
                                                <li>RSForms: Create customized forms with a user-friendly interface.</li>
                                            </ul>

                                            <h3>2. Modules</h3>
                                            <p>
                                                Want to display extra content in specific areas of your pages? Modules are your go-to solution. They’re lightweight extensions that show content in boxes or designated spaces. Think login forms, menus, or promotional banners.
                                            </p>
                                            <p><strong>Examples of Modules:</strong></p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Footer menus</li>
                                                <li>Sidebar navigation bars</li>
                                                <li>Custom call-to-action buttons</li>
                                            </ul>

                                            <h3>3. Plugins</h3>
                                            <p>
                                                Plugins add power by enabling extra features. They execute functionalities when specific events are triggered, giving your site advanced capabilities.
                                            </p>
                                            <p><strong>Example Plugin:</strong></p>
                                            <ul>

                                            </ul>

                                            <h3>4. Templates</h3>
                                            <p>
                                                Templates control the look and feel of your site. Whether it’s the style, colors, or layout, templates make it easy to create a cohesive theme.
                                            </p>
                                            <p><strong>Examples of Templates:</strong></p>
                                            <ul>

                                            <p>
                                                Languages allow you to translate your site, modify labels, or even add custom text strings. They ensure your content reaches diverse audiences worldwide.
                                            </p>
