                                            <h2>Overview</h2>
                                            <p>
                                                Max Planck Digital Library (MPDL) collaborated with us in 2020 to build a website that supports their Open Access agreements with academic publishers across Germany. This project presented both technical and creative challenges, as we worked to align MPDL’s vision with practical and intuitive design solutions. The outcome was a multilingual platform that enhanced access to research literature for institutions across Germany and highlighted our ability to translate client vision into a digital experience.

                                            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                                            <p>
                                                MPDL approached us to create a platform that would represent their nationwide Open Access agreements with major academic publishers. While the project goals were clearly defined, we encountered challenges in translating the passion of the MPDL team into actionable and visually compelling ideas.
                                            </p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Bridging the gap between the client’s enthusiasm and their ability to articulate specific design requirements.</li>
                                                <li>Collaborating with two client team members who were new to working with a digital agency, requiring us to provide additional guidance on defining and communicating their vision.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p>
                                                Our initial priority was to establish a clear and collaborative mode of communication, ensuring that their ideas were effectively translated into a cohesive platform design.

                                            <h2>About the Client</h2>
                                            <p>
                                                MPDL is a crucial player in Open Access publishing in Germany, negotiating and implementing agreements with leading academic publishers. Their efforts have significantly improved access to research literature, enabling academic institutions and researchers to benefit from expansive resources.

                                            <h2>The Solution</h2>
                                            <p>
                                                To kick off the project, the MPDL team provided us with basic mockups featuring a red color palette. From there, our development team enhanced these designs into a more refined and functional structure, ensuring they met modern usability standards.
                                            </p>
                                            <h3>Key elements of our approach included:</h3>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><strong>Efficient Navigation:</strong> Pages were structured with sidebar boxes and accordion features, ensuring thematic content was easily accessible.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Collaborative Feedback:</strong> Clear communication between the client project lead and our project manager paved the way for iterative improvements, made in small steps to avoid misalignment.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p>
                                                This collaborative process resulted in a final website design that exceeded the client’s expectations in both usability and visual appeal.

                                                This project underscored the importance of investing time upfront to align client expectations with development goals. Specifically:
                                            </p>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Establishing clear design expectations at the outset ensures smoother project progression.</li>
                                                <li>Finalizing mockups before development begins minimizes deviations from the intended design.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p>
                                                Our experience from this project has influenced how we approach client onboarding and communication for increased efficiency and satisfaction.

                                                The website content was deliberately structured to address various audience groups, including institutions, researchers, and the general public. Sidebar boxes with supplementary information and resources encouraged deeper engagement from users without overwhelming the main interface.

                                                Given the global nature of academic research, the platform was designed with multilingual capabilities. This ensured accessibility for an international audience, making the platform inclusive to non-German speakers.
